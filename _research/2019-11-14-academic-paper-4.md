## Abstract

This paper explores a **semi-device-independent** approach to **multiparty quantum key distribution (QKD)** in the asymptotic limit. The authors provide a framework for secure communication in multiparty quantum networks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of this approach in high-dimensional quantum systems.
