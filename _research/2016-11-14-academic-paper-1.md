## Abstract

This paper explores the use of **qutrit states** (three-dimensional quantum states) to enhance the key rate in **quantum key distribution (QKD)** systems. By employing askew aligned sources, the authors demonstrate a significant improvement in the efficiency and security of QKD protocols. The study provides a theoretical framework and experimental insights into the advantages of high-dimensional quantum states in secure communication.
